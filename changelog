0.1.21 Updated to R-2.4.0 build.  Put snp Annotation in featureData slot.
0.1.35 Updated vignette.  Added par(log) option to plotSnp and plotChromosome.
0.1.36 Updated plotSnp.  Added black and white option. Changed plotting of x-axis.
0.1.37 Updated plotChromosome xaxt option
0.1.38 Added black and white option to plotChromosome
0.1.47 use sqlite for annotation, rewrite show method for snpset
0.1.48 chromosome annotation automatically added (if NULL) in plotSnp method
0.1.49 removed getSnpAnnotation example in the help file since the pd.mapping annotation packages are not available on Bioconductor
0.1.50 modified show method to print all the chromosome annotation
1.1.1 changed SaveImage to LazyLoad
1.1.5 - argument xaxt="n" in plotSnp now completely supresses x-axis. 
	
      - if argument legend has length = 1, it will automatically be repeated
	(e.g., legend=FALSE converts to legend=c(FALSE, FALSE) and neither a legend
	for the plotting symbols or descriptive statistics will be displayed

	- removed fData and fData<- as these are now defined in Biobase
	with the exact same definitions

1.1.6 - removed fData help file

1.1.7 - changed generic for plotSnp

1.1.8 - removed the generic defintions for fData in SNPchip

1.1.9 - fixed problem with unmatched braces in help files

1.1.10 - added useLayout argument to plotSnp
	
1.1.11
	- added argument outer=TRUE to plotCytoband. Specifying
	outer=FALSE draws the axis for the cytoband within the plot
	margins

	- added argument cytobandAxis=TRUE to plotCytoband. When FALSE,
	the cytoband axis is not drawn and only the cytoband is displayed

1.1.12  
	- moved a few packges from Depends to Suggests. Tried to move
	oligo to suggests, but this didn't work

	- updated show method for AnnotatedSnpSet. To do this, I copied
	the selectSomeIndex method from Biobase (a method for data.frames)

	- added show methods for AnnotatedSnpCallSet and AnnotatedSnpCopyNumberSet

	- tinkered with the initialization methods for these classes...

	- Not sure what is causing this problem:
		* checking R code for possible problems ... NOTE
        	Error in expMethods[[i]] <- allMethodLists[ii] : 
	        more elements supplied than there are to replace
